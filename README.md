### Project 4 : Pixel Records
Django (backend) & React (frontend) App

## Concept
I rotate my games and when I go back to a game I haven't played for a while, I don't remember where I was or what I was doing. The games I play are usually linked up to the actual clock so it's day by day. I wanted to have a place where I could see my notes for a certain game. 

## Unsolved Problems
The 'create new event' button shows up and it looks weird

## Future Features
- user authentication
- better interface
- minor aesthetic edits
